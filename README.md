## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Software project developed with a GUI, where the methodologies learned throughout the semester were applied during the Laboratory II activity.
The problem was presented in iterations, and one of the goals was to ensure that the application's architecture supported incremental changes to the initially required requirements.

All2You is a fictional company that produces products for various other companies and aims to digitize its entire production process, which has so far been carried out manually by employees. The project serves as a solution to address the challenges of managing the company's entire range of products, orders, machinery, operators, and more.

The program includes:

- Order management
- Customer management
- Technical sheets

All the work presented in this repository is for educational porpuses, as well as demonstrating my approach to this course. I do not advise you to copy, the professors are very strict and have a very good algorithm for identifying code copied from a student that has already completed the course, and in case of foul play you may end up failing the curricular unit instantly. Do not cheat. 
PLUS: All projects developed for curricular units on this course may or may not have potential bugs.
